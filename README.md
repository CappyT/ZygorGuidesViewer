Zygor's Wildstar Leveling Guide is a software based strategy guide that you can view and use directly inside the game while playing. Each guide is written in an easy step by step format and tells you exactly where to go, who to talk to, what quests to accept, how to complete objectives, and more. 

This product was discontinued, the code was uploaded to GitHub.  And this is an unofficial update by me, while I work on a new Addon from scratch.

TODO's:
------

* Reduce use of API calls.  It do like around 10 every second!
* Update Exiles quests.
* Add dailies.
* Add path quests leveling.  Addon supports them, but are currently not included.
